**Abstract.** 
Centralization is bad for all stakeholders. We’re providing a way to decentralize something the average internet user today will understand. If we do our job right, they won’t be sure they’re using crypto at all.

**Introduction**
What's broken about crowdfunding. 

What everyone knows is broken
Fees
Censorship
Payout time tables

What crypto positive people know is broken
Not your db not your data
Not your keys, not your crypto.

Everyone loses in the crowdfunding space. Users pay high fees, in many cases they don’t own their content, and the content they can and can’t create is subject to the whims of the platform. 

Platforms are constrained by payment gateways/processors/banks resulting in a struggle between doing what's best for users and what's best for the platform. 

By using scalable decentralized services we eliminate many of these concerns. 

We realize some issues may need to be resolved in part with (censorship), but we plan to implement self governance and voting where the community can decide what content should be disallowed.

**The DApp**
MyEcho provides a secure / decentralized way for creators and supporters to interact with each other. MyEcho will be Web 2.0 on the outside and Open web throughout. Accounts will use familiar features (google, facebook, etc.) on the surface, but NEAR protocol & Tor.us/Ceramic under the hood. Data will be accessible and permissioned through the DApp, but stored in and managed in decentralized services; Skynet/Ceramic.

This app was initialized with [create-near-app]
